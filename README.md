<a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/6/6.005/s16/psets/ps3/">Problem Set 3: Expressivo</a>

In this problem set, we will explore parsers, recursive data types, and equality for immutable types.
Compared to the previous problem sets, we are imposing very few restrictions on how you structure your code. 
In addition, much of the code that you write for problems in this problem set will depend heavily 
on how you decided to implement earlier parts of the problem set. 
We strongly recommend that you read through the entire assignment before writing any code.
